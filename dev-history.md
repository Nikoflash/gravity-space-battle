# Gravity Space Battle - Multiplayer Development History

## Phase 1: Foundation Setup

### 2025-05-23 - Project Initialization

#### Current State
- Existing local multiplayer game with modular architecture
- Built with vanilla JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas
- Uses Parcel for bundling
- Well-structured codebase with clear separation of concerns

#### Starting the Multiplayer Expansion

**Objective**: Transform the local multiplayer game into an online multiplayer experience while maintaining the existing modular architecture.

### Step 1: Project Structure Analysis

Analyzed existing project structure:
```

│   ├── index.html
│   ├── styles.css
│   └── js/
│       ├── game.js
│       ├── config.js
│       ├── physics.js
│       ├── spaceship.js
│       ├── projectile.js
│       ├── collision.js

│       ├── input.js
│       ├── ui.js
│       └── menu.js
├── package.json
├── README.md
└── (build/dist folders)
```

### Step 2: Netlify CLI Setup

#### 2.1 Installing Netlify CLI globally
```bash
npm install -g netlify-cli
```

#### 2.2 Creating Netlify configuration
- Created netlify.toml for build settings
- Set up folder structure for serverless functions

#### 2.3 Environment Setup
- Created .env file for local development variables
- Added .env to .gitignore for security

### Step 3: Basic Networking Module Implementation

Creating foundational networking modules without breaking existing functionality:
1. network-manager.js - WebSocket connection management
2. lobby-system.js - Game room creation and joining
3. game-state-sync.js - Basic state synchronization

### Step 4: Serverless Function Setup

Setting up Netlify Functions for game server logic:
1. game-server.js - Main WebSocket handler
2. lobby-manager.js - Simple lobby management
3. game-data.js - Future Supabase integration

### 2025-01-24 15:30 - Phase 2 Bug Fixes

#### Issues Encountered and Fixed

1. **Module Export/Import Issues**:
   - **Problem**: "Cannot redefine property: GameStateSync" error from Parcel
   - **Cause**: Conflict between named and default exports in ES modules
   - **Fix**: Changed GameStateSync to use default export and updated all imports

2. **Missing Network Handlers**:
   - **Problem**: "No handler for message type: game-state-update" warnings
   - **Cause**: Server sending updates before client registered handlers
   - **Fix**: Added 500ms delay to server game loop start to allow client setup time

3. **Player Velocity Fields**:
   - **Problem**: Missing velocityX/velocityY causing undefined errors
   - **Fix**: Ensured velocity fields are initialized in PlayerManager

4. **Physics Engine Not Initialized**:
   - **Problem**: MultiplayerGame trying to use undefined physics
   - **Fix**: Ensure physics engine is created in MultiplayerGame constructor

#### Technical Improvements
- Added timestamps to force module reloads
- Improved debug logging throughout the system
- Fixed timing issues with game initialization
- Ensured handlers are registered before game starts
- Added state checks to prevent processing updates before game starts

#### Current Status
✅ Game starts without errors
✅ All players see synchronized gameplay
✅ Movement and physics work correctly
✅ Projectiles and combat functional
✅ Clean disconnection handling

The multiplayer system is now stable and ready for Phase 3 enhancements!
